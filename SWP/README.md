SWP - Semantic White Space Parsers

This was an experiment on two fronts - can you build a compiler, using test driven
development - including development of the grammar, and secondly, can you build a
programming language with no keywords - just white space for block structure?
The answer to both questions appears to be 'yes'. This is useful to keep around
since it shows some interesting ideas as to how to parse python/ruby like languages
and I've actively needed to refer back to this in recent months[1]
